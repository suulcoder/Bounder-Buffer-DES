Do not let the day end without having grown a bit, without being happy, without having risen your dreams. Do  not let overcome by disappointment. Do not let anyone you remove the right to express yourself, 
which is almost a duty. Do not forsake the yearning to make your life something special. Be sure to believe that words and poetry it can change the world. Whatever happens, our essence is intact. We are beings full of passion. Life is desert and oasis. We breakdowns, hurts us, teaches us, makes us protagonists of our own history. Although the wind blow against the powerful work continues: You can make a stanza. Never stop dreaming, because in a dream, man is free. Do not fall into the worst mistakes: the silence. Most live in a dreadful silence. Do not resign escape. "Issued by my screams roofs of this world," says the poet. Rate the beauty of the simple things. You can make beautiful poetry on little things, but we can not row against ourselves. That transforms life into hell. Enjoy the panic that leads you have life ahead. Live intensely, without mediocrity. Think that you are the future and facing the task with pride and without fear. Learn from those who can teach you. The experiences of those who preceded us in our "dead poets", help you walk through life. Today's society is us "poets alive." Do not let life pass you live without that. Carpe Diem Poem -Walt Whitman
